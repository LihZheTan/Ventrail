# Ventrail Dev Log

## Week 1 – Architecture & Foundation
**Done**
- Translated the class diagram (Fig 3.8) into code:
  - Models: `CommitNode`, `FileAsset`, `PeerNode`
  - Service contracts: `IRepositoryManager`, `INetworkNodeCoordinator`, `IIntelligentStorageEngine`, `ISpecializedFileHandler`
  - Implementations: `RepositoryManager` (early Git core work), plus stubs for
    `NetworkNodeCoordinator`, `IntelligentStorageEngine`, `SpecializedFileHandler`
  - `MainDashboardViewModel` (MVVM controller)
- Folder structure follows MVVM: `Models/`, `ViewModels/`, `Views/`, `Services/Contracts`, `Services/Implementations`.
- Git repository at solution level, pushed to GitHub (`LihZheTan/Ventrail`).

**Decisions**
- **WPF instead of WinUI 3.** WPF is mature, has strong MVVM tooling (CommunityToolkit.Mvvm),
  needs no MSIX packaging and has more documentation, which lowers risk in a 14-week timeline.
  Proposal section 1.4 already allows "WinUI 3/WPF".
- **Interfaces for every service.** The ViewModel depends on interfaces, not concrete classes,
  so stubs can be swapped for real implementations week by week without touching the UI.
- **Stubs throw `NotImplementedException`** with the planned week in the message, so an
  accidental call explains itself.

**Changes from the proposal design (update the class diagram in the CP2 report)**
- `IRepositoryManager` gained: `IsRepositoryOpen`, `ScanWorkingDirectory()`, `StageAll()`, `Unstage()`,
  `GetCurrentBranchName()`, `GetFilesInCommit()`, `RestoreFileFromCommit()`.
- `CommitNode` gained `ParentHashes` (DAG parent pointers), `ShortHash`, `DisplayTime`.
- `FileAsset` gained `IsStaged`, `DisplaySize`.

**Issues / notes**
- None yet.
